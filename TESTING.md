 Even if I have been testing the site throughout the development, I made a huge mistake of not documenting all the bugs I have fixed from the start. I will learn to do this on my other next projects!

Chrome Developer Tools was very useful in being able to pinpoint the code that needed tweaking to get elements working.

I used the W3C Validator to check my html and css source code and python tutor for my javascript.

## AUTOMATED TESTING

### W3C Validator

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the source code for both the html and css on all pages of the website.

There were a few times were i was missing spellings and the small things like semi columns dots and commas.

- ### For the whole quiz game

- The issue that troubles me more was the codeanywhere as i ended up loosing hope and using the offline IDE and it worked pretty well for me.
