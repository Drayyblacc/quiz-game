# QUIZ GAME BY DERECK YASU

Welcome to Online Quiz Game by Dereck - a portfolio quiz game. I have built this fully on code with html, css and javascript.

Online Quiz Game is built in html, css and javascript and it is not fully responsive on all devices as i did not have enough time to finish it because of the submition deadline how ever it is playable and looking forward to finish developing it soon. As a visitor you can play the quiz game, it has easy methemetical questions that only need one to know multiplication, division, addition and subtraction.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme for the website come from the developer to make sure everything is easily visible to the end user. The idea was to keep the quiz game looking colourful and beautiful.

### Typography

The fonts used on the website was chosen to make sure text is clear in all devices sizes

Google Fonts was used to import both fonts:

- Poppins is the font used on all of the text on the quiz game. This include both a bolder and a lighter font weight.

![Google Fonts used on Love Running by Dereck](assets/images/Screenshot 2023-10-13 at 00.57.58.png)

Font Awesome is also used for bullet points and the home index page and sign up page on the website.

### Imagery

The imagery on this website is all photography, with the odd Font Awesome icon appearing on the page. The favicon was from flaticon and some were from me, only the ones on README.

## Features

The Online Quiz Game has only one page but the page has feature of starting the game, rules and buttons to play also with a countdown timer to show the user how much seconds they have left with to answer the questions and it does not allow the user to choose an answer after the countdown timer expires, but it shows the user the answer in green color and not add a point to the score.

### General features on each page

- In the page thats where all features are and it also allows user to restart the game or quit the game.

#### Congratulations

A simple popup will show how much score the user got as a messege after finishing the game.

### Accessibility

I have tried my best to ensure the site has been made as accessible as possible by:

- Using simple HTML.
- Using alt attributes on images.
- Adding breathing text welcoming the user.
- Using colour contrasts between the text and background.

## Testing

I started this project in a wrong way as i was focusing mostly on function on the project i did not start the design with the mobile version so i have to add media queries for the devices and i will strong not suggest a developer to do that as that took most of my time trying to sort out and unfortunately did not finish the design properly.
